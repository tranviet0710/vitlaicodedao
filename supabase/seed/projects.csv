The client's legacy monolithic system crashed during Black Friday sales, resulting in 20% lost revenue. The goal was to build a system capable of handling 10k+ concurrent users with sub-200ms response times.

### The Constraints
- **Timeline:** 3 months before next major sale event.
- **Budget:** Strict resource allocation for infrastructure.
- **Zero Downtime:** Migration had to happen without interrupting ongoing sales.

### The Architecture
Transitioned from a monolith to a modularized service architecture:
- **Core Services:** User, Product, Order, and Inventory services separated for independent scaling.
- **Caching Strategy:** Implemented Redis for product catalogs to reduce DB load by 80%.
- **Event Bus:** Used RabbitMQ for asynchronous order processing.

### The Solution
- **Frontend:** Next.js for SSR to improve SEO and initial load time.
- **Backend:** Node.js services containerized with Docker.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with read-replicas for high availability.
- **Payment:** Stripe integration with webhook handling for reliable transaction processing.

### The Impact
- **Performance:** Successfully handled 15k peak concurrent users with 99.9% uptime.
- **Revenue:** 35% increase in conversion rate due to faster checkout flow.
- **Scalability:** Infrastructure costs reduced by 15% through optimized auto-scaling rules.";2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00;2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00

Employees were spending 20% of their time searching for internal documents across scattered repositories (Google Drive, Confluence, Slack).

### The Constraints
- **Data Privacy:** Sensitive internal data must not train public models.
- **Accuracy:** Hallucinations were strictly unacceptable for compliance documents.

### The Architecture
Implemented a RAG pipeline:
1.  **Ingestion:** ETL pipelines to scrape and index internal tools.
2.  **Storage:** Supabase pgvector for high-performance vector similarity search.
3.  **Generation:** GPT-4 with strict system prompts and context window management.

### The Solution
- **Vector Search:** Utilized cosine similarity to find relevant context chunks.
- **Frontend:** React-based chat interface with citation features (linking back to source documents).
- **Security:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensuring users only query documents they have access to.

### The Impact
- **Productivity:** Reduced information retrieval time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds per query.
- **Adoption:** Onboarded 500+ employees in the first month.
- **Cost:** Optimized token usage reducing API costs by 40% using semantic caching.";2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00;2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00

Syncing high-frequency heart rate data from a custom wearable device to a mobile app without draining battery or losing data packets.

### The Constraints
- **Hardware:** Low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) limitations.
- **Offline First:** App must function fully without internet.

### The Architecture
- **LocalDB:** WatermelonDB (SQLite) for offline data persistence.
- **Sync Engine:** Custom conflict resolution strategy for syncing local data with the cloud when online.

### The Solution
- **Mobile:** React Native with native modules for efficient BLE communication.
- **Optimization:** Batched data uploads to minimize radio usage.
- **Visuals:** Real-time D3.js graphs rendering 60fps on mobile devices.

### The Impact
- **Reliability:** 99.8% data sync success rate.
- **Efficiency:** Reduced app battery consumption by 25%.
- **User Growth:** Scaled to 50k active users within 6 months.";2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00;2025-11-12 13:02:38.470487+00

Traders needed sub-second visualization of market movements. Existing dashboard had a 5-second lag, unacceptable for high-frequency trading.

### The Constraints
- **Latency:** Max 500ms end-to-end latency.
- **Data Volume:** 5,000 events/second.

### The Architecture
- **Ingestion:** Go microservice using Goroutines for high-throughput event consumption.
- **Transport:** WebSockets for push-based updates to the frontend.
- **Storage:** TimescaleDB for efficient time-series data queries.

### The Solution
- **Frontend Optimization:** Virtualized tables and WebGL-accelerated charts to prevent DOM overload.
- **Data Aggregation:** Server-side aggregation to send only view-port relevant data.

### The Impact
- **Speed:** Achieved 200ms latency from event to visualization.
