List:\n   - Files to create/modify.\n   - Specific functions/components to change.\n   - Data model changes (if any).\n   - Verification steps (how to test).\n4. **Constraint:** Do **not** write final implementation code. Focus strictly on *how* and *where*.\n\nRefer to `AGENTS.md` for project-specific context."
